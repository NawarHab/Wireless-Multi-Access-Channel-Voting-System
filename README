mv arduino-nrf24l01/Mirf /usr/local/arduino-1.0/libraries
git clone git://github.com/silps/voteino.git
mkdir /usr/local/arduino-1.0/examples/Voteino /usr/local/arduino-1.0/examples/Voteino/server
mkdir /usr/local/arduino-1.0/examples/Voteino/client
mv voteino/voteino_client.ino /usr/local/arduino-1.0/examples/Voteino/client/
